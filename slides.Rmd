## What we will cover

We will cover differential expression analysis of RNA-seq data in R/Bioconductor.

We will start from a matrix of gene-level read counts.

We will cover the two most popular packages, `DESeq2` and `edgeR`.

I will also show you how to deal with unwanted variation using the `RUVSeq` package.

Other normalizations are accessible with `EDASeq` and `edgeR` packages. 

## What we will not cover

I will not talk about the preprocessing of RNA-seq data, i.e., what we do to obtain the gene-level read counts.

These steps are usually done with stand-alone software outside R.

I will not talk about isoform-level analysis and alternative splicing.

We will focus on gene-level differential expression.

## The Poisson Model

When statisticians see counts, they immediately think about Simeon Poisson.

## The Poisson Model

The Poisson distribution naturally arises from binomial calculations, with a large number of trials and a small probability.

It has a rather stringent assumption: **the variance is equal to the mean**!

$$
Var(Y_{ij}) = \mu_{ij}
$$

In real datasets the variance is greater than the mean, a condition known as **overdispersion**.

## A real example

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(edgeR)
y <- DGEList(counts = filtered, group = x)
y <- calcNormFactors(y)
design <- model.matrix(~x)
y <- estimateDisp(y, design)
meanVarPlot <- plotMeanVar(y, 
                           show.raw.vars=TRUE, 
                           show.tagwise.vars=FALSE,
                           show.binned.common.disp.vars=FALSE,
                           show.ave.raw.vars=FALSE, 
                           NBline = TRUE , nbins = 100,
                           pch = 16, 
                           xlab ="Mean Expression (Log10 Scale)", 
                           ylab = "Variance (Log10 Scale)" , 
                           main = "Mean-Variance Plot" )
```

## The Negative Binomial Model

A generalization of the Poisson model is the negative binomial, that assumes that the variance is a quadratic function of the mean.

$$
Var(Y_{ij}) = \mu_{ij} + \phi_j \mu_{ij}^2
$$
where $\phi$ is called the **dispersion parameter**.

Both `edgeR` and `DESeq2` assume that the data is distributed as a negative binomial.

- C57BL/6J adult male mice (2 months of age). 
- Five animals per group: fear conditioning (FC), memory retrieval (RT), and controls (CC).
- Illumina 100bp paired-end reads mapped to the mouse genome (mm9) using GMAP/GSNAP.
- Ensembl (release 65) gene counts obtained using HTSeq.
